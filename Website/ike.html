        <h3>Ike Jr.</h3>
        <p>Ike is a 3-year-old long-haired chihuahua bursting with energy and personality. Despite his small size, hes a whirlwind of excitement, often zipping around the house like a furry bolt of lightning. With a lively spirit that never seems to run out, Ike is always on the move, exploring, barking, and demanding attention with his signature brand of chaos.</p>
        <p>Hes easily the most vocal member of the household, out-shouting not only the other pets but even the humans. Whether hes announcing a visitor, demanding playtime, or simply voicing his opinion on absolutely everything, Ike makes sure his presence is always known. He loves chasing his toys with intense focus, only to immediately switch gears and start licking anything in sight—from furniture to fingers—like its his mission in life.</p>
        <p>When no ones watching, Ikes mischievous side comes out. One of his favorite sneaky hobbies is raiding the cat food bowls for a forbidden snack. His antics keep everyone on their toes, but its all part of his charm. Underneath the high-energy chaos is a dog who just wants to have fun, make noise, and maybe steal a bite or two along the way. Ikes wild energy, loud personality, and goofy habits make him the life of the party and a source of endless entertainment.</p>
