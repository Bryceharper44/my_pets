        <h3>Mordecai</h3>
        <p>Mordi is a 9-year-old long-haired chihuahua who fully embraces his role as the wise old man of the house. With his flowing coat and calm demeanor, he carries himself with a sense of seniority and entitlement thats both amusing and endearing. Hes the type of dog who has earned his routines and expects the world to move at his pace—slow, quiet, and cozy.</p>
        <p>Mordis favorite pastimes include long naps in soft blankets, soaking up the sun in a warm patch of light, and, of course, receiving endless pets. He’s never in a rush and prefers to take life easy, often found lounging in his favorite spots while the younger pets run around. His sleepy lifestyle makes him the perfect lap companion, always ready to settle in for a lazy afternoon.</p>
        <p>Though he prefers peace and relaxation, Mordi has a playful side that shows up in funny ways—especially when it involves his younger sibling Ike. One of his quirks is interrupting Ikes energetic play sessions, usually by plopping down in the middle of the action or nudging in for attention. Its his way of reminding everyone that, even in retirement mode, hes still part of the fun. Mordis charm lies in his old-soul personality, his love of comfort, and his subtle way of staying connected to the chaos around him.</p>
