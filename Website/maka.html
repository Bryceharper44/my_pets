        <h3>Makacita</h3>
        <p>Maka is a delicate and beautiful dilute calico cat with a tiny frame and the sweetest, most expressive eyes. At just 2 years old, she’s already shown an incredible amount of resilience and strength. When she was less than two months old, Maka was hit by a car and spent the first six months of her life blind. This early trauma left her a bit high-strung, and she’s often startled by sudden movements or sounds—even her own shadow can make her jump.</p>
        <p>Despite her cautious nature, Maka has a strong sense of boundaries and isn't afraid to let you know when she's had enough attention. She enjoys affection on her own terms, especially when it comes to brushing—one of her favorite things. With a few gentle strokes and the offer of a lickable wet treat, she’ll quickly warm up and show just how much she enjoys being pampered. Her love for grooming time is balanced by her independence, making her a cat that values trust and comfort.</p>
        <p>Maka may be small and skittish, but she’s also playful and full of curiosity. Just like her feline companion Soul, she can’t resist chasing a wand toy around the room, showing off her speed and agility. Watching her play is a reminder of how far she’s come from her difficult beginnings. Maka’s mix of vulnerability, confidence, and cuteness makes her a deeply lovable and unforgettable member of the family.</p>
